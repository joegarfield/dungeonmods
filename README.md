# dungeonmods

A very basic Forge 1.12 Mod that does the following:
- Helps comply to the Limited Account Policy rules - only permits approved usernames and IP addresses to join Shotbow - making accidental policy breaks difficult.
- Show block outlines on adventure mode.
- Make barrier blocks visible (approved by Roquel).
- Show wither hearts (can be done with texture packs, decided to make it a mod instead).
